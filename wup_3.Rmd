```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r include=FALSE}
require(tidyverse)
require(tigerstats)
davisdata <- read.csv(file="UCDavis.csv")
```
## Our Goal is to answer this question Is there a difference between the alcohol consumed between the row
## you choose to sit in??

## Now with ggplot - first select the basic data

```{r}
basicCN <- ggplot(davisdata,aes(y=alcohol,x=Seat))
```
## Now add in boxplot

```{r}
boxplot(alcohol~Seat,data=davisdata)
```

The box in the back row has a higher third quartile and the median looks slightly higher than the other boxes third quartile positions. Comparing the Middle and Front boxes we see both have a similar median and third quartile however the Middle box section has much more outliers. The boxes are not disjoint.
